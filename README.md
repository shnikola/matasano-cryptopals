# Matasano Crypto Challenges - a short review

Sometimes in 2013 (a more civilized time, when crypto was not dirty word), I participated in Matasano Cryptopals challenges via email. At one point I presumably got stuck and moved on to other things.

So here we are, 10 years later, doing it all over again. Not much has changed otherwise: I still adore Ruby, I still find cryptography fascinating but difficult. I'm not a bit smarter, maybe just a little wiser.

These challenges are still a great learning opportunity. The trouble is, they are not a great learning source. Quickly they become unclear and rushingly explained. They jumble describing both the attacker and the victim, making it difficult to recognize what data is available to whom. Worst of all, they are inconsistent in their helpfulness, sometimes giving you detailed instructions, and other times leaving you in the dark, wondering if you missed some crucial detail on what you're supposed to do.

(Also, the writing style is occasionally condescending, which I don't enjoy.)

Perhaps I am missing the point. Perhaps the main lesson is about doing your own research without any handholding. It was also created in author's spare time, given for free to anyone interested. I am absolutely grateful for that. And yet still I'm left with a nagging feeling this could be immensely improved.
